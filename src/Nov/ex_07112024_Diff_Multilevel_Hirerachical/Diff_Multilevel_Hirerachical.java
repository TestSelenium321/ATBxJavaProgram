    //*Structure:

    //Multi-level: Linear inheritance (A → B → C)
    //Hierarchical: Tree-like inheritance (B ← A → C)

    //Property Flow:

    //Multi-level: Properties flow from top to bottom through intermediate classes
    //Hierarchical: Properties flow directly from parent to multiple children

    //Relationship:

    //Multi-level: Each class has one parent and one child (except first and last)
    //Hierarchical: Parent class has multiple child classes

    //Usage Scenarios:

    //Multi-level: Used when each successive class adds its own specialized features
    //Hierarchical: Used when multiple classes share common features from a single base class
